# session-recording

Installs tlog package and cockpit session recording as well as puts a simple sssd.conf in place to record user sessions to demonstrate within Cockpit web UI.

**TODO** currently the user needs to login to Cockpit, go under session recording and save config settings. Need to automate this.
